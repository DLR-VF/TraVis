# Transport Visualizer (TraVis)

TraVis is a interactive, user-friendly and scalable web-based application for analyzing, communicating and validating the simulation data of a transport model, such as [_TAPAS_](https://www.dlr.de/vf/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-12751/22270_read-29381)
. 

TraVis is currently intended for internal use only. However, it is planned to make the application freely available as open source in the near future.

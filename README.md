# TraVis

A interactive, user-friendly and scalable web-based application for analyzing, communicating and validating the simulation data of a transport model, such as TAPAS. 

Currently, TraVis is intended for internal use only. But we are planned to make the application freely available as open source in the near future. 

For more information you can read our paper [_Shine on Transport Model Simulation Data: Web-based Visualization in R using Shiny_](https://www.thinkmind.org/index.php?view=article&articleid=data_analytics_2018_5_20_60060). This paper was presented at the IARIA Seventh International Conference on Data Analytics.
